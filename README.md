# Disease_Models
Geographical agent-based disease models based in Mesa, Repast, RDDL, and NetLogo. The model works as follows for all four models:

Each agent has a home, job, and two store locations. Each day is broken up into two time steps - one where agents are at their homes, and one where agents are at their job or a store (depending on their age, if they are a student, and if they are self-isolating). On every time step, agents who are infectious have a probability of spreading disease to other agents at that location based on the basic reproduction number (user-defined) and the density of agents at the location. When an agent contracts the disease, they have some user-defined probability of self-isolating (user-defined), where they remain at their home on all time steps and only spread disease to agents at their home. Agents can also mask and vaccinate. The probability of masking is user-defined and the probability of vaccinating is based on the agent's age, derived from data related to COVID-19. The efficacy of masking and vaccinating is user-defined. 

These agent-based models simulate disease based on the SEIR compartmental model, where agents are in one of four compartments (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered), beginning as susceptible by default, and flowing through them linearly when infectious (apart from the initially infectious agents defined at time step 0, who begin in the infectious compartment). Agents can spend any amount of time in the suscpetible compartment until infected, at which point they exist in the other 3 compartments one by one for some normally distributed amount of time specific to each compartment.

### RDDL Notes
The RDDL model does not currently make any use of the planner. It is simply a standard agent-based model that can be readily adapted to perform some planning-related task. The problem file given alongside the domain was generated based on Kingston Geography, with about 100 agents.
